In April 2022, I undertook an exciting project focused on Spotify music recommendation, natural language processing (NLP), and Tableau dashboard development. Through this project, I aimed to leverage data analysis techniques to enhance user satisfaction and provide valuable insights.

Key Result:
* Collected Spotify music data and performed sentiment analysis on 10K+ songs using NLTK, achieving 90% accuracy in detecting explicit lyrics and positive sentiment.
* Implemented techniques such as Count and Tfidf Vectorizers, LDA topic modeling, and cosine similarity-based recommendation models to predict song genres, uncover distinct topics in lyrics, and improve user satisfaction.
* Designed a Tableau dashboard with 4 interactive worksheets, enabling streamlined data visualization and analysis of key metrics, leading to enhanced decision-making and actionable insights for the team.
